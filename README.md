This repository contain the code for a Github Webhook service that restarts kubernetes deployments (such as [Mimalyzer](https://mimalyzer.indoorvivants.com/), [Scala Native bindings generator](https://sn-bindgen-web.indoorvivants.com/)) in my personal cluster.

The motivation for it is described in the [blog post](https://blog.indoorvivants.com/2025-10-20-restarting-kubernetes-deployments-with-github-webhooks-and-scala).

Code is not designed to be very reusable, it's for personal purposes only, but can serve as motivation.
